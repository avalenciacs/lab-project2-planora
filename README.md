# 🌍 Planora

**Discover. Plan. Experience.**

Planora is a travel planning web application where users can **discover, create and share real travel plans created by real people**, not generic recommendations generated by algorithms.

Each plan represents a concrete experience in a specific city — such as food routes, cultural visits, nature activities or nightlife plans — designed to inspire other travelers through authentic experiences.

## 🧠 Concept & Motivation

Most travel platforms focus on generic tourist attractions and rankings.  
**Planora focuses on authenticity** — real plans based on personal experiences, curated and shared by travelers themselves.

The main goals of the project are:

- Inspiration from real people  
- Simple and intuitive user experience  
- Scalable architecture for future social features (auth, likes, personalization)

---

## ✨ Main Features

- 🔍 Search plans by **city or country** (accent-insensitive)
- ⭐ Browse **top plans** based on popularity
- 📝 Create, edit and delete travel plans
- 🗂️ Activities grouped by category:
  - Food  
  - Culture  
  - Nature  
  - Experience  
  - Nightlife  
- 👍 Voting / likes system to highlight popular plans
- 📱 Fully responsive and mobile-friendly UI

-🧩 Data Model (Firebase Realtime Database)

Plans are stored with a scalable and flexible structure:

```json
{
  "plans": {
    "planId": {
      "title": "Foodie weekend in Bilbao",
      "country": "Spain",
      "city": "Bilbao",
      "coverImg": "https://...",
      "likes": {
        "userId1": true
      },
      "activities": {
        "a1": {
          "type": "food",
          "title": "Casco Viejo",
          "description": "Pintxos route"
        }
      },
      "createdAt": 1700000000000
    }
  }
}
```
