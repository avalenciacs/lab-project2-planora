# 🌍 Planora

**Discover. Plan. Experience.**

Planora is a travel planning web application where users can **discover, create and share real travel plans created by real people**, not generic recommendations generated by algorithms.

Each plan represents a concrete experience in a specific city — such as food routes, cultural visits, nature activities or nightlife plans — designed to inspire other travelers through authentic experiences.

## 🧠 Concept & Motivation

Most travel platforms focus on generic tourist attractions and rankings.  
**Planora focuses on authenticity** — real plans based on personal experiences, curated and shared by travelers themselves.

The main goals of the project are:

- Inspiration from real people  
- Simple and intuitive user experience  
- Scalable architecture for future social features (auth, likes, personalization)

---

## ✨ Main Features

- 🔍 Search plans by **city or country** (accent-insensitive)
- ⭐ Browse **top plans** based on popularity
- 📝 Create, edit and delete travel plans
- 🗂️ Activities grouped by category:
  - Food  
  - Culture  
  - Nature  
  - Experience  
  - Nightlife  
- 👍 Voting / likes system to highlight popular plans
- 📱 Fully responsive and mobile-friendly UI

## 🧩 Data Model  
**Firebase Realtime Database**

Plans are stored using a flexible and scalable structure:

```json
plans: {
  planId: {
    title: "Foodie weekend in Bilbao",
    country: "Spain",
    city: "Bilbao",
    coverImg: "...",
    description: "...",
    likes: {
      userId1: true,
      userId2: true
    },
    activities: {
      a1: {
        type: "food",
        title: "Casco Viejo",
        description: "Pintxos route",
        img: "..."
      },
      a2: {
        type: "culture",
        title: "Guggenheim Museum",
        description: "Modern art and architecture"
      }
    },
    createdAt: 1700000000000
  }
}
This structure allows:

Multiple plans per city

Unlimited activities per plan

Efficient filtering and sorting

Easy extension to user-based features
